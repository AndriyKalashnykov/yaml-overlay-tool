## Installation and Setup

The compiled `yot` binary can be downloaded from the repository's releases page [here](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu-labs/yaml-overlay-tool/releases).

Be sure to download the appropriate release for your system's architecture and Operating System.

On Linux and Unix based systems it is recommended to move the binary into your path, such as `/usr/local/bin/yot` or `/usr/bin`.

Once the `yot` binary is installed to a path in your system's `$PATH` you can then run the `yot` command.
