# Ensure Dependencies are Installed

`yot` is a Python 3 application, and therefore we need to ensure we have Python 3 on our system.

Run the following command to install Python 3 on Ubuntu/Debian based systems:

`sudo apt-get install -y python3`{{ execute }}

Next we must ensure that `git` has been installed to be able to clone the `yot` repository.

`sudo apt-get install -y git`{{ execute }}
