# Make sure we can run `yot`

To check if `yot` is properly installed, run the following command:

`yot -h`{{ execute }}


You should now see the `yot` help and usage instructions.  

If you get a message of `-bash: /usr/local/bin/yot: Permission denied`, then you will need to make `yot` executable by running the following command:

`chmod +x ~/git/yot/yot`{{ execute }}

You can run the following command to check if `yot` is now setup properly:
`yot -h`{{ execute }}


## Congratulations!

You now have your environment setup and are ready to get started learning how to use `yot`!
