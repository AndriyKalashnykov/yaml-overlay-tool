# Welcome!

Today we will learn how to create an untemplated or static `yot` instructions file.

* We will learn what an `yot` instructions file is

* We will work on modifying some existing Kubernetes manifests to demonstrate a real-world use-case

* We will validate that our overlays/patches to the original manifest have gone as expected

* We will demonstrate different ways of outputting the newly modified yaml content

* We will test that the manifest can be applied to a Kubernetes environment

First, let's learn about what an instructions file is.
