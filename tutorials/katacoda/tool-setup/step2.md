# Cloning the `yot` Project Repository

To be able to use `yot` we must clone the git repository.

First, let's make sure we are in our home directory.  We will make a new directory called `git` here:

`cd ~/ && mkdir git && cd git`{{ execute }}

Run the following command to clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/vmware-tanzu-labs/yot.git`{{ execute }}
