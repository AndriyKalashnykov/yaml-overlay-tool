We believe taking all of the templating out of base manifests and keeping it outside in an `yot` instructions file, is the right approach.  We believe we can achieve what a YAML templating tool can without contaminating source manifests with unnecessary code, while providing a flexible framework to meet just about any scenario.

Maybe we've sold you, maybe we haven't.
